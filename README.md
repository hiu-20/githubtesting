Hi I am Hiba Hammami
As a passionate and self-driven IT student , I thrive on learning and building solutions that bridge theory and real-world application. I’m skilled in a wide range of technologies including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, C, C++, Python, and databases, and I regularly use Cisco Packet Tracer to deepen my networking knowledge. Currently, I’m expanding my expertise in Docker and Node.js to better understand modern development and deployment practices. I enjoy tackling challenges, exploring new technologies, and continuously improving my skill set to stay aligned with industry trends. Whether it’s designing efficient systems or writing clean, maintainable code, I’m committed to delivering impactful digital solutions and growing as a versatile IT professional.
